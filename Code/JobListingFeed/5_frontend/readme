great.

okay. now lets initial the frontend

i plan to have just one page for this app, it will have several sections:
1. Header (with logo)
2. Navigation (only has one button, "New Job")
3. User profile input (it first give two buttons, "Manual" and "Upload"
if user click "Manual", it will show a form to input user profile
if user click "Upload", it will show a window for user to select a file from a list of file
after user input is done, there is a button "Submit" to submit the user profile, when clicked, it will send a request to the backend)
4. Job listing (after retrieving the job listing, it will show a row (rows) of job listing card, with each card has the job titile, company name)
   (upon clicking the card, it will show a modal with more detail of the job listing, when click anywhere outside the modal, it will close the modal)
   (there is a select button on top-right of each card)
   (there is a button "analyze" at the bottom of the job listing, when clicked it will send another reqeust to the backend to analyze the job listing)
5. Job analyze (after the job listing is analyzed, it will show the result of the analysis.)
6. Footer and credit (to Taylor Tang, myself)

before we moving on the the actual code, lets create the folder structure first.
name all the components.jsx needed for this app.
i will give your further instruction after you finish this task.
