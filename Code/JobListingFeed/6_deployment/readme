deployment start from setting up virtual environment on Azure (or any other platform).

In example of Azure:
1) Setup account, subscription, resource group, etc.
2) Create a virtual machine resource, choose the OS (ubuntu), and resource size.
3) Setting up network, open port 80, 443, 22, additional port for backend if needed.
4) Download the private key, chmod 400 the private key.
'''chmod 400 <private_key>'''
5) SSH to the virtual machine, install docker and docker-compose.
6) Add user to docker group. 
'''sudo usermod -aG docker $USER'''
'''newgrp docker'''
7) (optional) SCP docker yaml file to the virtual machine.

A example of docker yaml file:
```
version: '3'
services:
  database:
    image: marqoai/marqo:latest
    ports:
      - "8882:8882"

  backend:
    image:
After that, up services using docker-compose.
