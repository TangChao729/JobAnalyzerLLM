The initial version of this project is rely on a job listing dataset that is provided by kaggle.com(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings). The dataset is a collection of job listings from LinkedIn. The dataset is not complete and may not be up-to-date. The dataset is used for the purpose of testing the project. The dataset is not used for commercial purpose.

job matching function is implemented:
1. It takes the user input from GuidedUserInput section, with job level, job location and job title.
2. It encode all job title in the dataset and the user input.
3. Calculate the cosine similarity between the user input and all job title in the dataset.
4. Return the top 10 job title and job_ID that has the highest cosine similarity.
